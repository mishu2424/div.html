              Linus-Torvalds-LinuxCon-Europe-2014Ten years ago this week, the
              Linux kernel community faced a daunting challenge: They could no
              longer use their revision control system BitKeeper and no other
              Source Control Management (SCMs) met their needs for a distributed
              system. Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, took the challenge
              into his own hands and disappeared over the weekend to emerge the
              following week with Git. Today Git is used for thousands of
              projects and has ushered in a new level of social coding among
              programmers. To celebrate this milestone, we asked Linus to share
              the behind-the-scenes story of Git and tell us what he thinks of
              the project and its impact on software development. You’ll find
              his comments in the story below. We’ll follow this Q&A with a week
              of Git in which we profile a different project each day that is
              using the revision control system. Look for the stories behind
              KVM, Qt, Drupal, Puppet and Wine, among others.

              When it comes to web design, few people have been more important
              or influential than Håkon Wium Lie. Working at CERN alongside Tim
              Berners-Lee, the creator of the web itself, Lie is the man who
              gave it its familiar look by inventing CSS. Without that bold
              move, the whole business of web design could have been a totally
              different beast today. As Lie puts it: “This thing could have been
              owned by one company. It could have been France Telecom, it could
              have been Microsoft. It could have been one private owner.
              “Instead we have a web which is slightly disorganised, and there’s
              a lot of rubbish out there, but it’s also a wonderful place that
              reflects humanity as it should be. And it’s free for everyone to
              use.”
